# Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Analysis-
This Jupyter Notebook project explores deep RL agents (e.g. DQN) to model trading behavior and predict price movements for three selected companies. It simulates a trading environment, learning optimal buy/hold/sell actions from historical market data

# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict stock market behavior and simulate trading strategies. By applying deep Q-learning and other RL algorithms, the system learns optimal actions—buy, sell, or hold—based on historical stock price data.

- Simulates an RL trading agent in a virtual market environment.
- Utilizes historical stock data for three major companies.
- Learns a dynamic trading policy by maximizing cumulative reward.
- Demonstrates how RL can adapt to market conditions and make investment decisions.
